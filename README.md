This is a coding calisthenics project to set up a Java spring boot app
end to end, with individual component scaling and messaging. It uses
Docker for local development and hopefully for deployment.

It represents a notification API that can take in messages from approved
clients and transform/broker them to any of a number of preconfigured
destinations like e-mail, in-app notification on various sites/clients,
messaging services, etc.

This doesn't fill a specific need and isn't intended really for distribution.
It exists primarily to build my muscle at configuring, building, and deploying
services from the ground up.
